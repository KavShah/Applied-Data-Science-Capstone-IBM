    "This dataset contains check-ins in NYC and Tokyo collected for about 10 month (from 12 April 2012 to 16 February 2013). It contains 227,428 check-ins in New York city and 573,703 check-ins in Tokyo. Each check-in is associated with its time stamp, its GPS coordinates and its semantic meaning (represented by fine-grained venue-categories). This dataset is originally used for studying the spatial-temporal regularity of user activity in LBSNs.\n",
